# Data Engineering Studies

Some data engineering projects and studies made by me during the IGTI professional/specialization course. Here I share

1. ENADE 2019
  * Data extraction tests: connecting to the website programatically, scrapping the necessary data base and extracting it locally with _python_'s _io_, _zipfile_ and _pandas_;
  * Data transformation tests: exploring the data set with _pandas_;

2. Twitter 
  * Streaming: gathering real-time tweets using the Twitter API, _tweepy_, _json_ and _pandas_
